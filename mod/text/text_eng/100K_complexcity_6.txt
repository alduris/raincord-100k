This pearl is very interesting!

It's a set of schematics for a conduit system for an iterator intended to be built far south of here.

Do you know what conduits are?

Conduits are an array of mechanisms located near the bottom of the main superstructure. <LINE>They're a vital part of a large system and even more important to the Iterator's life.

The system that conduits are a part of starts in the ground below. Iterators need to be built near a large groundwater supply. <LINE>Water is drawn up through a large pipe system from lakes, oceans, or underwater reservoirs and funneled through more pipes in the structure's legs.

Once this water is inside the structure, it goes to a conduit. Conduits themselves serve to prepare the water for use throughout the structure. <LINE>They feed micro-organisms, generate power for electrical and biomechanical functions, cool electical components, and more that I can't get into.

Then the remaining waste is simply ejected back down the legs and thrown into a drainage system near the Iterator's complex. It is no longer useful.

Conduits can also overdraw groundwater, but alongside greatly increasing performance this is very dangerous for everyone involved...

Simply put, if the conduits are compromised the Iterator will slowly die. <LINE>It pains me to imagine how many of us out there are in this very predicament.

Thank you for listening to my lecture, <PLAYERNAME>. I appreciate it.
