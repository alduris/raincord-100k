It's just plain text. I will read it aloud.

"As Interest in---and, by extent, both Funding and Religious Support for---the Research and Extraction of Void Fluid grows,<LINE>many of our most Esteemed Peers, including our Most Venerable House of Lakes, have given their Full Support in the task of<LINE>reaching the Ever Deeper and Ever Purer reaches of the great Void Sea.

It is because of this Great Interest that we (our many Graced Contributors towards Drilling Operations, <LINE>including those Engineers, Scientists, Managers, Grounds Workers, [...]) must bring to light our most Recent Discovery <LINE>in the field of Deep-Void Research and Extraction.

As proven by recent Data Reports from our Deepest Excursions in drilling operations, it is Most Evident that <LINE>the Deeper Reaches of the Void Sea are not, as some had previously been led to believe, a Stagnant Body.

Rather, all evidence would Prove to Indicate a most Erratic and Volatile source of disturbance which has caused <LINE>Irreparable Damage and unfortunate loss of Resources within cycles of recent Deep-void Operations.

The most Remarkable Evidence to support this Claim, as given within the following Reports and Data Tables by <LINE>our most Venerated Head of Operations, proceed as follows:"

The rest of the pearl is filled with data sets which I doubt you'd have much interest in.

It's an early theory on the existence of large forces within the deeper reaches of the Void Sea. 

These ideas became rather common once Void Fluid extraction was extended past near-surface level pockets, <LINE>but I don't recall any proper consensus being made, in the end...

Perhaps you will find that out for yourself some cycle, <PLAYERNAME>.
