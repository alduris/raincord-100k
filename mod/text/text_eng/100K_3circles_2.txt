It's a broadcast log from one of the regional threads. Even when I was still standing, many of them were in the process of breaking down.

I'm surprised this one is still operational. It appears to be some idle conversation, I'll read it to you.

"[LIVE BROADCAST]<LINE>1678.352 - REGIONAL THREAD<LINE>5 participants (99+ idling)

PV: I have been iterating on a long-term climate model for the global climate, mostly standard stuff.<LINE>I tweaked some of the variables and observed the planet-wide effects they had.

PV: Few of the runs produced anything of note, but there was one that stood out.<LINE>In that one, I had reduced the combined heat generation of all Iterators until an arctic climate formed in the polar regions.

PV: The simulation resulted in a positive feedback loop. Iterators in arctic conditions would be unable to melt <LINE>sufficient feedwater for themselves and become incapacitated. This would push the planet further into an ice age, <LINE>making arctic conditions spread to even more Iterators. This cycle continued until most of us had collapsed.

IJC: May we see the full details of your simulation?

PV: [FILE ATTACHMENT: climatological_run_079.vdyt]

DO: Those are some intriguing results... however, I can see from the initialization conditions that this would practically never occur.

AW: I agree with DO here, there's no way our heat output could get reduced by this much.

EEH: well, maybe if a lot of us get incapacitated or smth then maybe?

EEH: but like, we don't really collapse at all to begin with

IJC: Theoretically, it could be met if all of us were operating at reduced capacity. That would only feasibly occur through<LINE>long-term decay though, assuming we didn't perform regular maintenance for some reason.

PV: It was more of a curiosity than anything else. I doubt the requirements for this scenario to play out will ever be met,<LINE>even in the distant future. It was just something interesting I wanted to shar-"

The broadcast log abruptly cuts off here. This pearl has been exposed to the elements, <LINE>rendering most of its contents faded and unreadable.

In my current state, I can't recall who any of these Iterators are.<LINE>But... I find myself agreeing with them. This is a very far-fetched scenario!

Thank you for this, <PLAYERNAME>! It brings back pleasant memories of conversations with my local group!
