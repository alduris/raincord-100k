This pearl seems to be from when the ascension occurred. Interesting.

Would you like me to read it to you?

"The day has finally came, and they're coming for me. As I put down the information of the last details of my existence, <LINE>I know what's going to happen to me. They're going to drag me to the seas. 

I know I will not ascend fully, I was never ready. I will be stuck here in a hell of my own creation for eternity. <LINE>But if that must be, let me put down one thing that I wish to say. That I wish to put down as the last showing of my existence, no matter how brief it may be.

Bees.

Those bastardly things, they sting, they swarm, and one time in my creche days- they ate and broke down the walls of my halls. 

Those damnable things, most say they help create life. But I know the truth. Those things do nothing but bring death. 

Those things deserved to be burnt to ashes and nothing more, if by whatever force out there, they they make me ascend-

I swear that whatever remains of me, I will make sure to tell the next civilization; from whatever comes out of <LINE>our corpse to DESTROY AND RAZE FROM THE CYCLE THOSE ABOMINABLE MISTAKES OF CREATION!!!! I WILL-"


I... Don't think you should hear the rest of this pearl, <PLAYERNAME>. 

This one might have went off the deep end during the last years of our creators.
