This pearl seems to be a young person's ramblings and theories on the world.<LINE>They have little understanding of iterators, of course, so their theories don't hold up particularly well.

Most of what's been written down by them is either blatantly wrong, incredibly long stretches, <LINE>or vague statements that don't clear up anything, although they act like they've just discovered fire.

I have to admire their determination and dedication to this pearl, as they seemed to have updated it frequently. <LINE>It even has some qualia attached from different dates, such as very roughly recorded videos and crudely drawn charts, <LINE>connected together with red string on a corkboard...

Admirable nonetheless, I suppose!
