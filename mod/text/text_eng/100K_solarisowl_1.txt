This is an introduction guide on how to fly sky-sail, basic instructions, how to read clouds, and safety guidelines.

Sky-sail predate the creation of first iterators, and it evolved alongside us. Not just changing their materials from wood and canvas <LINE>into fiberglass and synthetic fiber, but the gliders also adapt the sport to use our breath.

Even when iterators are not breathing out rain, we are still much warmer than surrounding areas, and that creates air that rises near our can, <LINE>flowing toward our facility ground and cools, then return to us, this effect know as Iterator Heat Island. <LINE>The sky-sailers use the warm updraft to fly. 

However, some sky-sailers use the storm we produce to fly.

It is a common misconception that updraft in thunderstorm is always turbulent, where near the iterators' vents, the staircase-like vapor blows strong and smooth.

It is tempting to many sky-sailers, but also harder to control, or if you got too near toward the downdraft areas <LINE>you can easily be pulled down, and not to mention all the lightning in the clouds!

Despite how dangerous it was, it didn't stop thrill seeking citizens trying, and some lost their lives.

At one point it became such a trend that several cities outright banned the whole sport. Didn't stop citizens trying...
